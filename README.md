Good Day Panel Of Judges 

What if an NFT project becomes a source of investment? is that possible? I believe that an NFT's value can be increased if they're launched as a brand. With a strong brand, NFT creators can easily craft business ideas to generate consistent revenues. For example, if an NFT creator creates income through social media monetization, merch sales, and brand collaboration. However, it's challenging to reach that level of achievements without a strong group of supporters and investors. Therefore, the project can be crafted as an investment with the promise of rewarding NFT owners financially.

This project aims to build a Dapp that allows NFT creator to buy and sell NFT's, and also by voting with a unique NFT collection i created on opensea,  
which makes it easy for people to vote across the world, once they also own the unique NFT.
, once they also own the unique NFT.
 By utilizing the polygon network, transaction fees are kept to a minimum and maximum transparency.

 The rationale of this idea is to make creators, brands, arstist, musicians, realtors, footballers make money from their stuffs and also making it worthy for the buyer, in the NFT voting category it will help people to vote on a decentralized platform which cannot be tampered with, and also to make choices, within their day to day activities.

 How it's made
 1. NFT Voting Smart Contract
 By creating a unique collection on opensea, anybody that has one of the NFT in the collection will be able to vote and interact with other people, which people can use to ask Question and interact, which i deployed to the polygonscan > mumbai testnet, i was even surprised when i perform the function of the voting on polygonscan and it perfectly worked out, i was so happy.
 2. NFT Marketplace Smart Contract
 In Order To make my project more universal i decided to build an NFT Marketplae alongside the initial project i wish to build which was the voting system, and it also perfectly worked out. You can buy & list your NFT's on the contract, all of which was deployed to the polygon network.
 3. Two NFT Smart Contract for testing purpose, i also deployed two NFT smart contracts with minting function so that i can test and stimulate voting interaction and buying, listing of NFTs
 4. A Next App(Which i was unable to finish, so i decided not to waste my time and submit the backend,i would be so grateful if my project is granted)
 I intend to build a large front end website for the voting and NFT marketplace where all brands, creators , artiste, realtors, footballers, & and brands can list their product and get paid where buyers can also make money from the product when it rise, but time was against me, and i don't want to be a burden to my team mates, because i am a slow learner, i wish if i can get a certificate, i will be grateful.

 Big Up to the management of polgon company in india and xend finance in Nigeria, the knowledge was truly in-depth, i wish to always participate in your hackhathons in the future.

 Thanks,
 Dele.
